# Tracery Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary
Tracery is an open-source, privacy-focused metasearch engine maintained by Arachne Digital. Forked from the archived searx project, Tracery aggregates search results from over 70 sources without tracking users, empowering individuals, and organisations to gather intelligence privately and securely. As a key part of Arachne Digital’s Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) ecosystem, Tracery is committed to community-driven development and continuous updates, aiming to become the leading metasearch engine for privacy-conscious users.

## Milestones and Rationale

### Milestone 1: Security Testing and Remediation
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct penetration testing to identify security issues.
  - Review and prioritise findings based on severity and impact.
  - Implement remediation measures to address identified issues.
  - Update security documentation to reflect findings and actions taken.

- **Rationale**: This milestone ensures Tracery's foundational security by identifying and mitigating security issues early. Establishing a secure baseline is essential for maintaining user trust and protecting sensitive data. This sets the stage for future developments by ensuring a robust and secure platform. Note that security testing will become an annual event as Arachne Digital grows.

### Milestone 2: Transition to Memory Safe Programming
- **Tasks**:
  - Audit the codebase for memory-unsafe code.
  - Prioritise critical components for migration to memory-safe languages.
  - Enhance current security practices related to memory safety.
  - Train the development team in memory-safe programming languages.
  - Align the transition with Arachne Digital’s long-term business goals.
  - Implement and monitor the migration process.

- **Rationale**: Transitioning to memory-safe programming enhances Tracery's security and resilience against common vulnerabilities. By addressing these issues, Tracery not only secures its current operations but also builds a future-proof foundation that can support more complex and secure features in later milestones.

### Milestone 3: Maintenance and Community Building
- **Tasks**:
  - Establish monitoring and maintenance processes for supported search engines.
  - Streamline onboarding new search engines with comprehensive documentation.
  - Launch community engagement initiatives to attract contributors and raise awareness.

- **Rationale**: Building a strong foundation and an active community is crucial for Tracery's growth and sustainability. By ensuring that the metasearch engine remains up-to-date and functional, and by fostering a supportive community, Tracery can scale more effectively and adapt to evolving privacy needs.

### Milestone 4: Feature Expansion and Stakeholder Engagement
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy a public web instance of Tracery.
  - Continue community engagement to attract new contributors.
  - Research and integrate dark web search capabilities.
  - Engage with major search engines and other stakeholders to gather input and explore collaborations.

- **Rationale**: Expanding Tracery’s features and engaging with stakeholders enhances its functionality and broadens its appeal. The public launch increases visibility, while stakeholder engagement ensures that Tracery’s development aligns with broader industry trends and user needs.

### Milestone 5: Enhancing User Experience
- **Tasks**:
  - Refine the user interface and experience.
  - Improve search result presentation and filtering options.

- **Rationale**: Enhancing the user experience makes Tracery more accessible and user-friendly, encouraging adoption by a broader audience. This milestone builds on the previous ones by ensuring that the platform's functionality is matched by an intuitive and efficient interface.

### Milestone 6: Scaling and Sustainability
- **Tasks**:
  - Optimise infrastructure to handle increased traffic and usage.
  - Develop a sustainability plan including funding sources and partnerships.
  - Begin localisation efforts to translate Tracery into multiple languages.

- **Rationale**: Scaling infrastructure and planning for long-term sustainability are key to supporting Tracery’s growth. As the user base expands, ensuring reliable performance and sustainable development practices will be critical to maintaining momentum and meeting global user needs.

### Milestone 7: Global Recognition
- **Tasks**:
  - Position Tracery as the leading metasearch engine for privacy-conscious users.
  - Increase visibility through publications, forums, and conferences.
  - Build partnerships to enhance capabilities and reach.

- **Rationale**: Achieving global recognition is the culmination of the previous milestones. By positioning Tracery as a leader in the privacy-focused search engine space, this milestone secures its role as a trusted tool for users worldwide and establishes its presence in the broader digital landscape.

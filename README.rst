Project Mission & Summary
#########################

Tracery is an open-source initiative dedicated to enhancing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) by automating the process of collecting data. Our mission is to empower security professionals, organisations, and analysts by providing efficient, empowering, and community-driven CTI capabilities.

Tracery in Simple Terms
#######################

Tracery is a tool for searching the internet based on key words.

Tracery was originally forked from searx, and we wanted to build upon it. Later, the searx project announced that it was no longer maintaining searx. Arachne Digital has a committment to maintaining abandoned open source software that we use, so Arachne Digital will support Tracery into the future.

Why Use Tracery
###############

Tracery is a fork of the popular searx metasearch engine, created to address the need for a robust and well-maintained search solution. Here are some reasons why you should choose Tracery over other metasearch engines:

Active Maintenance and Updates: Tracery is actively maintained by a dedicated team, ensuring that the engine stays up-to-date with the latest search engine changes, security patches, and feature enhancements.

Enhanced Privacy and Security: Tracery is designed with a strong focus on user privacy and security, which carries over from the original searx project. Unlike many other metasearch engines, Tracery does not track your searches or store any personal information.

Community-Driven Development: Tracery is developed with input from the community, ensuring that the features and improvements are aligned with the needs of the users. You can contribute to the project, suggest new features, and report issues through our GitHub repository.

Project Description
###################

Tracery is an essential component of Arachne Digital's Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) ecosystem. As a powerful metasearch engine, Tracery is designed to streamline the process of gathering relevant and actionable intelligence from diverse sources across the internet. 

At its core, Tracery enhances the efficiency of CTI gathering by aggregating search results from multiple search engines and repositories. Tracery gathers information from a wide range of sources, including blogs, forums, research papers, threat databases, and news sites. This extensive data collection ensures that no critical intelligence is overlooked.

Required Resources
##################

Creating and maintaining Tracery requires a diverse set of resources. Some of these resources are provided by Arachne Digital, the for-profit company that maintains Tracery. However, the collective is strong through diversity, which is why Arachne Digital is opening Tracery up to the community. From design and development to community building and infrastructure, here is what powers Tracery:

* Design: Craft an intuitive user experience with UI/UX design and establish Tracery's unique identity through branding and visual elements.
* Development: Skilled developers, machine learning experts, data managers, cybersecurity specialists, and quality assurance testers bring Tracery's software to life, ensuring it is robust and secure. CI/CD pipelines keep everything running smoothly.
* Community Building: Our community thrives with dedicated managers, vigilant moderators, and technical writers who create comprehensive documentation and tutorials for Tracery's users and contributors.
* Infrastructure and Hardware: Server infrastructure, data backup, scalability measures, and cloud resources guarantee a seamless experience for Tracery's users.
* Additional Resources: Tracery also commits to legal compliance, marketing, outreach, community events, maintenance, and support. Plus, we actively contribute to other open-source projects, fostering collaboration across the ecosystem.
